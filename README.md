Covid-19 Analysis ,Visualization and Forecasting
==============================
![](reports/figures/images.png)


Coronavirus is a family of viruses that can cause illness, which can vary from common cold and cough to sometimes more severe disease. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) were such severe cases with the world already has faced.
SARS-CoV-2 (n-coronavirus) is the new virus of the coronavirus family, which first discovered in 2019, which has not been identified in humans before. It is a contiguous virus which started from Wuhan in December 2019. Which later declared as Pandemic by WHO due to high rate spreads throughout the world. Currently (on the date 29 Aug 2020), this leads to a total of 900K+ Deaths across the globe.
Pandemic is spreading all over the world; it becomes more important to understand about this spread. This is an effort to analyze the cumulative data of confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases over time. In this notebook, the main focus is to analyze the spread trend of this virus all over the world and its predictions.
